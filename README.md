# Rogue
#### A rougelike clone using Python v.3+

I'm using the **[libtcod](https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod)** library to explore and comprehend basic engine construction. Understanding engine structure will help with development of future projects and ideas.



## ____________________

Following **[this tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/)**, which has been updated to include newer Python 3 syntax and libtcod functions.

### Progress:

[Part 1](http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/part-1/): get input and draw the character.

[Part 2](http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/part-2/): 'Entity', render functions, and the map.

-> **[Part 3](http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/part-3/)**: Generating a dungeon.
